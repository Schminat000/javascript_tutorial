# Overview

The software created was to learn the basics of how to use Javascript in HTML. I created a calculator, a function to find the factorial of a number, and a simple array with modifications.

The reason I did this was to learn the basics of Javascript and get more comfortable with it. Now that I have the basics down, I will be able to start creating a simple game in a browser. I love video games and feel passionately that I can learn new things to be able to make video games soon.

* Visual Studio Code
* Javascript

# Future Work

* I plan to figure out a different way of doing the calculator. Everytime I use a different function, the words of the button show up on the calculator.
* Now that I've learned some basics of Javascript, next, I want to make a simple in-browser game.
* Maybe I will add some CSS elements to the program so it looks nicer.
